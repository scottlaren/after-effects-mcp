# Contributing

For this fork, start with [the Windows CEP setup](README.md#setup) and
[the transport design and acceptance checks](docs/MODAL-SAFE.md). The upstream
release automation described below is disabled in forks; this repository is not
published to the upstream npm package.

Thanks for your interest in improving After Effects MCP. This guide covers local
setup, the test workflow, and the conventions the project follows.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later to run the server; Node 20 or later to run the test suite
  (Vitest 4 requires Node 20+)
- Adobe After Effects 2022 or later (only needed to test against a live AE bridge)

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottlaren/after-effects-mcp.git
cd after-effects-mcp
npm install            # installs deps and builds
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enable the commit-message hook (see below)
```

## Everyday commands

```bash
npm run build       # compile TypeScript + copy the bridge script into build/
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit, no output
npm test            # run the Vitest unit suite
npm run test:watch  # watch mode while developing
```

Please run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before opening a pull request. CI
runs the same checks on Linux, macOS, and Windows across Node 18, 20, and 22.

## How the project is laid out

- `src/index.ts`: the MCP server, tool definitions and the file-bridge dispatch.
- `src/cep/`: the CEP panel, session history and file polling driver. Idle polling
  must not call ExtendScript; actual commands are dispatched once through CEP.
- `src/lib/bridge-core.ts`: pure, unit-tested helpers (result parsing, preset
  path resolution, id generation). Put logic here when it can be tested without
  a running server or a live After Effects.
- `src/scripts/mcp-bridge-auto.jsx`: the ExtendScript panel that runs inside
  After Effects and executes queued commands. This is ES3-era ExtendScript, not
  Node: no modern JS built-ins without the polyfills already at the top of the file.
- `tests/*.test.ts`: Vitest unit tests. The `tests/*.cjs` files are manual probes
  that talk to a live AE instance and are not part of the automated suite.

## The bridge, in one paragraph

The server (Node) and the panel (ExtendScript) never call each other directly.
They exchange two JSON files in a shared folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ae-mcp-bridge`
on Windows, `~/Documents/ae-mcp-bridge` on macOS): the server writes a command
with a unique id, the panel executes it and writes back a result echoing that id.
Every command is matched by id so results never cross wires.

## Adding a tool

1. Register it in `src/index.ts` with a `zod` schema and a clear description.
2. If it needs new panel behavior, add a `case` in `src/scripts/mcp-bridge-auto.jsx`
   and bump `BRIDGE_VERSION` there and `EXPECTED_BRIDGE_VERSION` in `src/index.ts`
   together, so `check-bridge` can flag a stale panel.
3. Address AE properties by `matchName` (e.g. `ADBE Position`), not by localized
   display name, so the tool keeps working on non-English After Effects.
4. Add unit tests for any pure logic you introduce.

## Conventions

- Keep commit messages free of em-dashes. The `.githooks/commit-msg` hook enforces
  this; enable it once with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- Prefer editing existing files over adding new ones.
- Match the surrounding code style; keep new modules focused and testable.

## Pull requests

Open PRs against `main`. Describe what changed and why, note anything you tested
against a live After Effects, and make sure CI is green.

**PR title must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):**
this repo squash-merges, so the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`, and
that message is what decides the next version and changelog entry (see Releasing
below). [`pr-title-lint.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml) checks this on
every PR and fails the check if it doesn't match.

- `fix: ...` - a bug fix, ships as a **patch** release.
- `feat: ...` - a new capability (tool, optional parameter, accepted value), ships
  as a **minor** release.
- `feat!: ...` or `fix!: ...` (bang before the colon) - a breaking change, ships as
  a **major** release. Explain what breaks in the PR description.
- Anything else conventional (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, ...) is
  accepted but does not trigger a release on its own.

If a PR's actual content doesn't match its title's prefix (e.g. titled `fix:` but it
actually adds a new optional parameter), the release-versioning bug this exists to
prevent has just moved from "the release-mistake" list to "the wrong-title" list -
please pick the prefix by what the diff actually does, the same rule as the version
bump itself.

## Releasing

Releasing is automated by
[`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), Google's own
release-automation tool, via
[`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`](.github/workflows/release-please.yml):

1. As PRs with conventional-commit titles land on `main`, release-please keeps an
   open "Release PR" up to date: it computes the next version from the accumulated
   `fix:`/`feat:`/`feat!:` prefixes (same rules as [Semantic
   Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) above) and writes the
   corresponding `CHANGELOG.md` section from the actual PR titles/descriptions.
2. Nothing publishes automatically just from merging regular PRs. Publishing
   happens only when a maintainer reviews and merges that Release PR - this is the
   explicit go-ahead point, review the generated version bump and changelog there.
3. Merging the Release PR tags the release and publishes a GitHub Release, which
   triggers [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml)
   automatically: it type-checks, tests, and publishes to npm with a [provenance
   attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).

Do not run `npm publish` or hand-edit `version` in `package.json` directly; the
Release PR is the only path that changes it, and the workflow is the only publish
path.

This requires two repository secrets:

- `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`: a fine-grained PAT (not the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub
  blocks the default token's own actions from triggering other workflows, which
  would silently prevent the Release PR's merge from firing `publish.yml`) scoped to
  `Contents: Read and write` and `Pull requests: Read and write` on this repo.
- `NPM_TOKEN`: an npm **Automation** token (Account Settings → Access Tokens →
  Generate New Token → Automation on npmjs.com). Automation tokens are built to
  publish from CI without an interactive 2FA prompt, and cannot change account or
  org settings.

Add both under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions in the GitHub repo.
